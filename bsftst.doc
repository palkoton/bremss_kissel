Thank you for your interest in our atomic-field bremsstrahlung
data.  The BSF program computes the bremsstrahlung shape function
and energy spectrum to an estimated accuracy of 10% or better for
2<=Z<=92, for electron kinetic energy of 1-500 keV.  An earlier
version of this code was used to produce the tables in Kissel,
Quarles and Pratt, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables vol. 28,
p. 381 (1983).

The following files are used in the BSF sample problem:

     BSF.FOR - bremsstrahlung shape function source code.  This
         code is written to conform to ANSI-standard Fortran 77.
         It has compiled and run under VMS on a VAX, and Lehay
         Fortran on an IBM-compatible PC.  Professor Quarles at
         Texas Christian University is responsible for the
         internal algorithms.  BSF reads input from the user (on
         the default input device), and from the files ESPEC.DAT
         and BMDATA.DAT.  It outputs its results to the user (on
         the default output device) and to the file BSF.OUT.

     ESPEC.DAT - energy-spectrum benchmark data.

     BMDATA.DAT - shape-function-fit benchmark data.

     BSFTST.COM - VAX/VMS command procedure which compiles, links
         and runs the code on a sample problem.

     BSFTST.LOG - log file of a sample BSF run produced using
         BSFTST.COM on a VAX 11/785.

     BSFTST.OUT - sample output from BSF using the BSFTST.COM
         procedure.

     BSFTST.DOC - a text file contining this description of BSF
         files.
